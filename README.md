# 🧮 Solana Calculator Program

## 🚀 What's the vibe?
A Solana-based calculator program built with Anchor framework that lets you perform calculations on-chain! No more boring traditional calculators - we're bringing math to the blockchain! 

## 🎯 The Tea
- **What's this?** A Solana smart contract that performs basic calculations
- **Why should you care?** Because who doesn't want to do math on the blockchain? It's like having a calculator that's also a flex 💅
- **What's in it for you?** Secure, decentralized calculations with that sweet, sweet blockchain security

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Anchor Framework** - For building Solana programs
- **Rust** - For the smart contract logic
- **TypeScript** - For testing and client integration
- **Solana** - The blockchain platform

## 🏃‍♂️ Let's Get This Bread
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone [your-repo-url]

# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Build the program
anchor build

# Run tests
anchor test
```

## 🎮 How to Use
1. Set up your Solana development environment
2. Deploy the program to your preferred Solana cluster
3. Interact with the calculator through the client interface

## 🧪 Testing
```bash
# Run the test suite
yarn test
```
